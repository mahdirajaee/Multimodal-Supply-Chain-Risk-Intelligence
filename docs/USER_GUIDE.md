  - Moderate potential for disruption
  - Consider mitigation strategies
  - Increased monitoring recommended

- **0.6 - 0.8**: **High Risk** (Red)
  - Significant potential for disruption
  - Implement mitigation strategies
  - Consider alternative plans

- **0.8 - 1.0**: **Critical Risk** (Dark Red)
  - High probability of severe disruption
  - Immediate action required
  - Activate contingency plans
